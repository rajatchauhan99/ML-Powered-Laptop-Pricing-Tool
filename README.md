# ML-Powered-Laptop-Pricing-Tool


- Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based laptop price predictor designed to help users estimate the price of a laptop based on various features, such as the processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and more. The machine learning model employed in this project has been meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset of laptop specifications and corresponding prices, ensuring accurate and reliable price predictions.

- Key Features and Highlights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes a comprehensive exploratory data analysis phase, encompassing univariate and bivariate analyses. These analyses provide insights into the relationships between different laptop features and their impact on pricing. EDA helps in understanding the dataset and identifying patterns, outliers, and trends.

- Feature Engineering
To enhance the model's predictive capabilities, we've conducted extensive feature engineering. This process involves transforming and creating new features to improve the model's performance. 

- Machine Learning Pipelines
We've implemented machine learning pipelines to streamline the model-building process. These pipelines ensure data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation are executed seamlessly, providing a structured and organized approach to machine learning model development.

- Function Transformation
Function transformations are applied to the data to handle various aspects of feature engineering and data preprocessing. These transformations are essential for preparing the dataset for machine learning and optimizing model performance.

- Sklearn Libraries
This project leverages the power of scikit-learn (Sklearn) libraries, a versatile and widely-used machine learning library in Python. Sklearn provides a plethora of tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, making it an ideal choice for developing a laptop price prediction model.-- Project Overview This project is a machine learning-based laptop price predictor designed to help users estimate the price of a laptop based on various features, such as the processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and more.
